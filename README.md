#JETS command line tool

*IMPORTANT NOTE* - Yes, this does store your etsjets login in plaintext, but this is only ever on your local computer
 it will never get put on the internet, and is stored in a place where there is no possibility. It sends a post request to 
 the login url for ETSJETS.org with that information, and is as secure as logging in directly. 
 
 More info coming soon.
